# =========================
# Niri Config for Void Linux (Wayland)
# Modern dark theme, gaps, borders, rounded corners, Windows-like shortcuts
# Primary location for the Niri configuration file is:
# $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/niri/config.kdl
# else
# ~/.config/niri/config.kdl
# if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set or is empty: Compliant applications will automatically use $HOME/.config as the default location for their configuration files.

[volume]
# Pipewire volume control via keybindings (see [keybindings] below)

[brightness]
# Brightness control via brightnessctl (see [keybindings] below)

[screenshot]

# =========================
# Notes & Best Practices
# =========================
# - Use 'Super' for Windows key for familiar shortcuts.
# - Use 'foot' for terminal, 'fuzzel' for launcher, 'lf' for file manager, 'waylock' for lock.
# - Pipewire and brightnessctl are controlled via keybindings.
# - For rounded corners, set 'border_radius' in [theme].
# - For gaps and borders, set 'gap' and 'border_width' in [theme].
# - To apply config, restart niri (Super+Shift+Q).
# - For more, see: https://niri.windowmanager.org/manual.html
